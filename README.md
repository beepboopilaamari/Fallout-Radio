    album: "Galaxy News Radio",
    url: "music/fo3/voicelines/three-dog-01.mp3"

    title: "[News Report]",
    artist: "Galaxy News",
    album: "Wasteland Updates",
    url: "music/fo3/news/super-mutant-sighting.mp3"
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Audio Won't Play

**Solution**:

**Solution**:
- Verify `stations.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`

### Theme Not Saving

**Issue**: LocalStorage disabled or browser in private mode

**Solution**:
- Enable cookies/storage in browser settings
- Exit private/incognito browsing mode

### Poor Performance

**Issue**: CRT effects causing lag

**Solution**: Reduce or disable effects in `styles.css`:
- Comment out `.crt-overlay` animations
